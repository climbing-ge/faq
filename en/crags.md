- https://27crags.com/crags/dzevri/ - wrong location, here is more correct:
    - https://goo.gl/maps/advmDMnf2X6jn55Z7 - central sector (approach from a closed restaurant)
    - https://goo.gl/maps/uA5jfA8gfz9jbrxo8 - a sector next to the road (everything pretty clean, 3 paths)
    - Near river sector: there is also 5с/6a, you need to go down from the right of the road
    - Better to use google maps or  maps.me
